# Stack on ARM

Docker images for running [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) on ARM.

The latest version (as far as I am aware) of GHC that is supported on ARM is 8.6.3 on LTS-13.3.

## Usage

Pull the images from [Dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/mcgizzle/repository/docker/mcgizzle/stack-arm).

`docker pull mcgizzle/stack-arm`
`docker pull mcgizzle/stack-arm-postgres`

## But why

I use these images to run Haskell on a RaspberryPi 4.
